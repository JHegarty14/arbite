<p>
  sept is a lightweight, opinionated web framework for <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank">Rust</a>. It is designed for ease of adoption and use through targeted use of metaprogramming.

### Philosophy

Rust, as a language, has seen a surge in popularity among developers for whom performance, safety, and reliability are front of mind. Despite this growth, Rust has yet to gain the same kind of traction languages like TypeScript (via Node.js), Java, Go, or C# have enjoyed as a go-to language among organizations focused on application engineering. This is due in no small part to Rust being a relative newcomer on the scene, but it also faces resistance due to the common perception of it as challenging to train or hire developers for. sept seeks to lower the barrier to entry for teams and organizations by providing a framework with comprehensive code-gen, minimal boilerplate, and an opinionated architecture that stresses loosely coupled, easily testable, composable components.

sept is heavily inspired by NestJS and the iDesign methodology for architecting software.
